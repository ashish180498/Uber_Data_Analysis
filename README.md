# Uber Pickup Data Analysis

## Introduction

In this project, I conducted an analysis of Uber pickup data to explore the maximum rush hour, identify the month with the highest number of Uber pickups, and perform spatial analysis using Basemap to visualize the data as a heatmap. Additionally, I've added interactive elements using Plotly and Folium to make the analysis more engaging. This Markdown file serves as documentation of the project's key findings and insights.

## Data Source

The Uber pickup data used for this analysis . The dataset contains information about Uber pickups, including timestamps, locations, and other relevant details.

## Analysis

### Maximum Rush Hour

To determine the maximum rush hour, I analyzed the timestamp data in the dataset. Here are the key findings:

- The maximum rush hour for Uber pickups is betweenwith the highest number of pickups occurring at 

### Maximum Uber Pickup Month

To identify the month with the highest number of Uber pickups, I aggregated the data by month and counted the pickups. Here are the results:

- The month with the maximum number of Uber pickups is , with a total of  pickups.
-

### Spatial Analysis with Basemap Heatmap

To perform spatial analysis, I used the Basemap library to create a heatmap of Uber pickups. Here are the key findings and the heatmap visualization:

### Interactive Visualizations

#### Plotly

I've created interactive Plotly visualizations to allow users to explore specific aspects of the data interactively:

- **Interactive Rush Hour Analysis:**
  - [Include a Plotly interactive chart that allows users to select a time range for rush hour analysis.]
  
- **Interactive Monthly Analysis:**
  - [Include a Plotly interactive chart that allows users to explore monthly data interactively.]

#### Folium

I used the Folium library to create an interactive map that allows users to explore the data geospatially:

- **Interactive Pickup Locations Map:**
  - [Include an interactive Folium map that allows users to filter and explore pickup locations by various criteria such as time, month, or other relevant factors.]

## Conclusion

In this data analysis project, I explored Uber pickup data to determine the maximum rush hour, identify the month with the highest number of pickups, and visualize the data spatially using a heatmap created with Basemap. Additionally, I enhanced the project with interactive elements using Plotly and Folium, providing an engaging and user-friendly experience for exploring the data.

## Future Work

For future work, I plan to further enhance the interactivity of the project by incorporating additional features such as filtering options, tooltips, and real-time updates into the Plotly and Folium visualizations. Additionally, I will explore advanced machine learning models for predictive analysis.
